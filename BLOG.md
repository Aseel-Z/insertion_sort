![Pass 1](pass-1.PNG)

In the first pass through of the insertion sort, we assign the array element at index 1 to a temporary variable. We check if the first element is larger than second array element we swap values. Such that first element becomes second elemnt and vice versa.


## Pass 2:
![Pass 2]()

In the second pass through of the insertion sort, we evaluate if there is


## Pass 3:
![Pass 3]()

In the first pass through of the insertion sort, we evaluate if there is


## Pass 4:
![Pass 4]()

In the first pass through of the insertion sort, we evaluate if there is


## Pass 5:
![Pass 5]()

In the first pass through of the insertion sort, we evaluate if there is


## Pass 6:
![Pass 6]()

In the first pass through of the insertion sort, we evaluate if there is
